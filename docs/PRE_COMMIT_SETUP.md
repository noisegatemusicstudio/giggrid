# Pre-Commit Setup with SonarQube Integration

This repository now includes comprehensive pre-commit hooks that ensure code quality before commits are made.

## What's Included

### 🔍 Code Quality Checks

- **ESLint**: Automatic linting and fixing of JavaScript/TypeScript issues
- **Prettier**: Automatic code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Type checking for all staged files
- **Jest**: Test execution to ensure no breaking changes
- **SonarQube Integration**: Code quality analysis framework

### 🚀 Pre-Commit Process

When you run `git commit`, the following happens automatically:

1. **Lint-Staged Execution**: ESLint and Prettier run on staged files
2. **ESLint Auto-Fix**: Automatically fixes linting issues where possible
3. **Code Formatting**: Prettier formats code according to project standards
4. **TypeScript Compilation**: Checks for TypeScript errors
5. **Test Execution**: Runs all tests to ensure nothing is broken
6. **SonarQube Analysis**: Framework for quality analysis

### 📋 Available Scripts

```bash
# Manual quality checks
npm run lint              # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix          # Run ESLint with auto-fix
npm run format            # Format all files with Prettier
npm run format:check      # Check if files are formatted
npm run sonar             # Run SonarQube scanner
npm run sonar:analysis    # Full analysis: lint + test + sonar
npm run pre-commit-check  # Run all pre-commit checks manually

# Testing
npm test                  # Run tests
npm run test:coverage     # Run tests with coverage
npm run test:watch        # Run tests in watch mode
```

### ⚙️ Configuration Files

- **`.husky/pre-commit`**: Pre-commit hook script
- **`.prettierrc`**: Prettier configuration
- **`.prettierignore`**: Files ignored by Prettier
- **`package.json`**: Lint-staged configuration
- **`sonar-project.properties`**: SonarQube configuration

### 🔧 Manual Pre-Commit Check

To manually run all pre-commit checks without committing:

```bash
npm run pre-commit-check
```

### 🚫 Bypassing Pre-Commit (Not Recommended)

In emergency situations, you can bypass pre-commit hooks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency commit"
```

**⚠️ Warning**: This should only be used in exceptional circumstances as it bypasses all quality checks.

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

#### Pre-commit fails with ESLint errors:

1. Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix issues
2. Manually fix remaining issues
3. Commit again

#### Pre-commit fails with TypeScript errors:

1. Check the file paths mentioned in the error
2. Fix TypeScript compilation issues
3. Commit again

#### Pre-commit fails with test errors:

1. Run `npm test` to see detailed test results
2. Fix failing tests
3. Commit again

### 📈 SonarQube Integration

The framework is ready for SonarQube integration:

1. **Local Analysis**: TypeScript compilation and ESLint checks
2. **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions runs SonarQube analysis
3. **Quality Gates**: Prevents commits that don't meet quality standards

### 🎯 Benefits

- **Consistent Code Quality**: All commits meet established standards
- **Automatic Fixes**: Many issues are resolved automatically
- **Early Error Detection**: Catch issues before they reach the repository
- **Team Consistency**: Everyone follows the same coding standards
- **CI/CD Integration**: Quality checks run both locally and in CI/CD

This setup ensures that every commit maintains high code quality and follows project standards!
